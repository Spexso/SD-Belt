This is the report of implementing 'h8l architecture .hef model running on hailo accelerator chip'

repo link : "https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/tree/main/runtime/cpp/object_detection"

Note : this repo has h8 model but we have h8l (lite version architecture) 
so we get the lite version compatible from following link:
"https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo/blob/master/docs/public_models/HAILO8L/HAILO8L_object_detection.rst"

**SOME NOTES
repo suggest installing libboost related packages like this:
"apt install -y libboost-format-dev libboost-program-options-dev"

but this after 
"make -j$(nproc)"
we got this error:
"fatal error: boost/format.hpp no such file or directory"
it turns out desired file is in core libboost-dev

so we corrected way of installing libraries:
"sudo apt install -y libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev"


!!! this is not tested but it is recommended to use absolute path

give permission to download_resources.sh file for best practice 
before "./download_resources.sh"
"chmod -x download_resources.sh"

instead of running :
"./build.sh"

"mkdir -p build && cd build"
"cmake .."
"make -j$(nproc)"

example run (mind the '=' symbol and make sure there is no gap between)
"./obj_det -hef=/home/sd_belt/object_detection_example/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/cpp/object_detection/yolov8n.hef \ 
-input=/home/sd_belt/object_detection_example/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/cpp/object_detection/bus.jpg"

**FUTURE WORK
using the camera on rpi as input
